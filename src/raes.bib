  abstract = "A semi-empirical relation is presented that connects global
              sea-level rise to global mean surface temperature. It is proposed
              that, for time scales relevant to anthropogenic warming, the rate
              of sea-level rise is roughly proportional to the magnitude of
              warming above the temperatures of the pre-Industrial Age. This
              holds to good approximation for temperature and sea-level changes
              during the 20th century, with a proportionality constant of 3.4
              millimeters/year per degrees C. When applied to future warming
              scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this
              relationship results in a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5
              to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level.",

              altimeter data for 1993--2009 and from coastal and island
              sea-level measurements from 1880 to 2009. For 1993--2009 and
              after correcting for glacial isostatic adjustment, the estimated
              rate of rise is 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 mm year−1 from the satellite data
              and 2.8 $\pm$ 0.8 mm year−1 from the in situ data. The global
              average sea-level rise from 1880 to 2009 is about 210 mm. The
              linear trend from 1900 to 2009 is 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 mm year−1 and
              since 1961 is 1.9 $\pm$ 0.4 mm year−1. There is considerable
              variability in the rate of rise during the twentieth century but
              there has been a statistically significant acceleration since
              1880 and 1900 of 0.009 $\pm$ 0.003 mm year−2 and 0.009 $\pm$
              0.004 mm year−2, respectively. Since the start of the altimeter
              record in 1993, global average sea level rose at a rate near the
              upper end of the sea level projections of the Intergovernmental
              Panel on Climate Change's Third and Fourth Assessment Reports.
              However, the reconstruction indicates there was little net change
              in sea level from 1990 to 1993, most likely as a result of the

              glaciological conditions required for large sea-level rise to
              occur by 2100 and conclude that increases in excess of 2 meters

              accelerated conditions lead to total sea-level rise by 2100 of

  author   = "Nicholls, Robert J and Tol, Richard S J and Vafeidis, Athanasios
              T",
  abstract = "The threat of an abrupt and extreme rise in sea level is widely
              discussed in the media, but little understood in practise,
              especially the likely impacts of such a rise including a
              potential adaptation response. This paper explores for the first
              time the global impacts of extreme sea-level rise, triggered by a
              hypothetical collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). As
              the potential contributions remain uncertain, a wide range of
              scenarios are explored: WAIS contributions to sea-level rise of
              between 0.5 and 5 m/century. Together with other
              business-as-usual sea-level contributions, in the worst case this
              gives an approximately 6-m rise of global-mean sea level from
              2030 to 2130. Global exposure to extreme sea-level rise is
              significant: it is estimated that roughly 400 million people (or
              about 8\% of global population) are threatened by a 5-m rise in
              sea level, just based on 1995 data. The coastal module within the
              Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution
              (FUND) model is tuned with global data on coastal zone
              characteristics concerning population, land areas and land use,
              and then used for impact analysis under the extreme sea-level
              rise scenarios. The model considers the interaction of (dry)land
              loss, wetland loss, protection costs and human displacement,
              assuming perfect adaptation based on cost-benefit analysis.
              Unlike earlier analyses, response costs are represented in a
              non-linear manner, including a sensitivity analysis based on
              response costs. It is found that much of the world's coast would
              be abandoned given these extreme scenarios, although according to
              the global model, significant lengths of the world's coast are
              worth defending even in the most extreme case. This suggests that
              actual population displacement would be a small fraction of the
              potential population displacement, and is consistent with the
              present distribution of coastal population, which is heavily
              concentrated in specific areas. Hence, a partial defence can
              protect most of the world's coastal population. However,
              protection costs rise substantially diverting large amounts of
              investment from other sectors, and large areas of (dry)land and
              coastal wetlands are still predicted to be lost. Detailed case
              studies of the WAIS collapse in the Netherlands, Thames Estuary
              and the Rhone delta suggest greater abandonment than shown by the
              global model, probably because the model assumes perfect
              implementation of coastal protection and does not account for
              negative feedbacks when implementation is imperfect. The
              significant impacts found in the global model together with the
              potential for greater impacts as found in the detailed case
              studies shows that the response to abrupt sea-level rise is
              worthy of further research.",

  abstract = "Despite the uncertainty in future climate-change impacts, it is
              often assumed that humans would be able to adapt to any possible
              warming. Here we argue that heat stress imposes a robust upper
              limit to such adaptation. Peak heat stress, quantified by the
              wet-bulb temperature T(W), is surprisingly similar across diverse
              climates today. T(W) never exceeds 31 degrees C. Any exceedence
              of 35 degrees C for extended periods should induce hyperthermia
              in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat
              becomes impossible. While this never happens now, it would begin
              to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 degrees C, calling
              the habitability of some regions into question. With 11-12
              degrees C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the
              majority of the human population as currently distributed.
              Eventual warmings of 12 degrees C are possible from fossil fuel
              burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of
              unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of
              possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may
              help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record.",

               introduce a map on how to think about risks, and in particular
               uncertainty, which is arranged along the different questions of

               and distinguishing between five different levels of uncertainty.
               I will argue, through some concrete examples, that concentrating
               on the objects of uncertainty can give us an appreciation on how
               different perspectives on a given risk scenario are formed and

               then, numerous independent studies have affirmed that
               anthropogenic climate change is underway, and the
               meta-conclusion that there is a broad expert consensus on this
               point. It has also been demonstrated that most of the challenges
               to this claim come from interested parties outside the
               scientific community. But even if we allow that the challenges
               to climate science are politically or economically motivated, it
               does not prove that the scientific consensus is correct. In
               other words, even if we accept the fact of scientific consensus,
               how do we know that this consensus is not wrong? This chapter
               addresses this question by examining a set of criteria that
               philosophers have traditionally or recently identified as
               possible bases for trust in scientific conclusions, and shows
               that climate science meets all of these criteria. Thus, while
               there is no way to know for sure that scientists are correct in
               their conclusions, the various means we have to test and
               evaluate scientific claims lead to the conclusion that, so far
               as we are able to tell, it is most likely that scientists are

  abstract  = "Anthropogenic sea-level rise (SLR) causes considerable risks.
               Designing a sound SLR risk-management strategy requires careful
               consideration of decision-relevant uncertainties such as the
               reasonable upper bound of future SLR. The recent
               Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fourth
               Assessment reported a likely upper SLR bound in the year 2100
               near 0.6 m (meter). More recent studies considering
               semi-empirical modeling approaches and kinematic constraints on
               glacial melting suggest a reasonable 2100 SLR upper bound of
               approximately 2 m. These recent studies have broken important
               new ground, but they largely neglect uncertainties surrounding
               thermal expansion (thermosteric SLR) and/or observational
               constraints on ocean heat uptake. Here we quantify the effects
               of key parametric uncertainties and observational constraints on
               thermosteric SLR projections using an Earth system model with a
               dynamic three-dimensional ocean, which provides a mechanistic
               representation of deep ocean processes and heat uptake.
               Considering these effects nearly doubles the contribution of
               thermosteric SLR compared to previous estimates and increases
               the reasonable upper bound of 2100 SLR projections by 0.25 m. As
               an illustrative example of the effect of overconfidence, we show
               how neglecting thermosteric uncertainty in projections of the
               SLR upper bound can considerably bias risk analysis and hence
               the design of adaptation strategies. For conditions close to the
               Port of Los Angeles, the 0.25 m increase in the reasonable upper
               bound can result in a flooding-risk increase by roughly three
               orders of magnitude. Results provide evidence that relatively
               minor underestimation of the upper bound of projected SLR can
               lead to major downward biases of future flooding risks.",

               exploration tools for many-objective optimization and
               sensitivity-based discovery of critical deeply uncertain
               factors; and (2) a web-based visualization toolkit for exploring
               high-dimensional datasets to better understand system
               trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. We demonstrate
               the OpenMORDM framework on a challenging environmental
               management test case termed the ``lake problem''. The lake
               problem has been used extensively in the prior environmental
               decision science literature and, in this study, captures the
               challenges posed by conflicting economic and environmental
               objectives, a water quality ``tipping point'' beyond which the
               lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple deeply
               uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of pollution
               management policies. The OpenMORDM software framework enables
               decision makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios, quantify
               the trade-offs between alternative strategies in different
               scenarios, flexibly explore alternative definitions of
               robustness, and identify key system factors that should be
               monitored as triggers for future actions or additional planning.
               The web-based OpenMORDM visualization toolkit allows decision
               makers to easily share and visualize their datasets, with the
               option for analysts to extend the framework with customized
               scripts in the R programming language. OpenMORDM provides a
               platform for constructive decision support, allowing analysts
               and decision makers to interactively discover promising
               alternatives and potential vulnerabilities while balancing
               conflicting objectives.",

  abstract = "Many institutions worldwide are considering how to include
              expectations about future sea level rise into their investment
              decisions regarding large capital infrastructures. This paper
              examines how to characterize deeply uncertain climate change
              projections to support such decision by examining a question
              facing the Port of Los Angeles: how to address the potential for
              presumably low probability but large impact levels of extreme sea
              level rise in its investment plans? Such extreme events---for
              instance, increased storm frequency and/or a rapid increase in
              the rate of sea level rise---can affect investments in
              infrastructure but have proved difficult to consider in such
              decisions because of the deep uncertainty surrounding them. This
              study uses a robust decision making (RDM) analysis to address two
              questions: (1) under what future conditions would a Port of Los
              Angeles decision to harden its facilities against extreme sea
              level rise at the next upgrade pass a cost-benefit test, and (2)
              does current science and other available information suggest such
              conditions are sufficiently likely to justify such an investment?
              A decision to harden at the next upgrade would merit serious
              consideration for only one of the four Port facilities considered
              and hardening costs would have to be 5 to 250 times smaller than
              current estimates to warrant consideration for the other three
              facilities. This study also compares and contrasts a robust
              decision making analysis with a full probabilistic analysis.
              These two analysis frameworks result in similar investment
              recommendations but provide different information to decision
              makers and envision different types of engagement with
              stakeholders. In particular, the full probabilistic analysis
              begins by aggregating the best scientific information into a
              single set of joint probability distributions, while the robust
              decision making analysis identifies scenarios where a decision to
              invest in near-term response to extreme sea level rise passes a
              cost-benefit test, and then assembles scientific information of
              differing levels of confidence to help decision makers judge
              whether or not these scenarios are sufficiently likely to justify
              making such investments. Keywords:",
